# Integrify

**Integrify** is a Python library that simplifies third-party API integrations.
Every integration ships as its own package — install only what you need:

```bash
pip install integrify                 # shared core only
pip install integrify[clopos]         # core + Clopos
pip install integrify[all]            # every integration
```

Every request comes in both **sync** and **async** flavours, with full type-hint support.

## Integrations
